##### Summary:
This paper explore the ability of agent based model to explain crime statistics, specifically in he city of Leeds, UK.
The paper explores the major factors when analyzing and predicting crime statistics, such as tyes of perpetrators, victims,
places of occurence (factoring visbility of houses, local community, occupancy of houses, etc.), and the type of community
that surrounds the perpetrator and victim. In order to reduce the complexity of the model, rather than modeling all people
in a city, the authors included "layers" that represent the different non-central aspects of the model, such as the surrounding
community and probability of occupancy of buildings. Using real geographic data they then calculated the risk of diffent properties
to crime as well as likely traffic on different streets. For the burgler, the model computed likelyhood of burglery with factors
such as drugs in system, sleep, and socialization, then modeled the agen while deciding where to start looking for victims,
searching for a victim,deciding upon a suitable target. After running the model with specific areas of the enviroment recieving
"urben regeneration", it found that crime was simply concentrated elsewhere.
