##### Summary:
This paper examines the use of agent base models in the realm of long-term teaming, (i.e. project teams lasting between projects).
Models in the past have assumed the successfullness of teams based on the net sum of the abilities within the team, so 
switching memebers of two teams will not substantially affect the total productivity of both team. But, reality is not so simple
and even cummulatively low ability teams can outperform their higher ability conterparts given the right scenarios.
