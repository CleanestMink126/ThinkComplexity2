##### Summary:

This paper observed the migration patterns in Burkina Faso, a poor, dry area in Africa that relies mostly on crops for their economy. With global warming, this area is producing more and more "enviromental refugees" that are forced to less dry areas by changing weather patterns. The paper explores the migrations of Burkina Faso through an agent based model taking into account past actions, expectations of others, attitudes of migration, and different enviromental, economic, and political factors. They then ran their model over many years, computing the decision to move oncea year for each agent. They validated their model with data from the area in the last 30 years and found substantialy correlation between predicted and actual data points. They then ran their model into the future with diffeent key scenarios and plotted several paths of migration that the area could take in the next 50 year.
