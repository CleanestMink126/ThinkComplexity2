##### Summary:
  This paper explored the spread of viral videos, specifically "Gangnam Style" on the internet. The group showed that they were
able to construct a model that accurately portrayed the spread of viral videos by examining the number of common followers
between different regions.
First, they constructed a graph of 261 large administrative geographical regions in the internet, then connected the nodes
and weighted each node based on individual level followers between regions. Next, by using both google trends
and tweet keyword analysis was able to map the prevalence of Gangnam Style in each region over time. By approximating the
origin of the video, they were able to model the time it took for gangnam style to reach each region based on either
geographical distance from origin, or the graphical model distance from the origin. They were then able to indicate the
validity of their model by showing the linear trend between time to region and distance in their model compared to the lack of
a trend in time to region and geographical distance to region.
