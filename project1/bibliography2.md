##### Summary:
This paper explored a model of graph growth and it's emergent properties. The method of growth was 
for every new node added, it was randomly assigned to a node in the graph, and then randomly connected
to a neighbor of that node. The paper cited several applications of this application in the past with
directed graphs and proposed to further explore the concept in the context of undirected graphs, which 
better approximate topics such as social media connections, which are often two way. However, they did
not much go into the connection of this growth to real world systems, but rather explored some
conterintuitive properties of the network, mostly the surprising amount of "star structures" that arise.
Star structures are when a single node is the only connection between all other nodes in the graph. They
appear at a startling amount for this growth, with a 2/(N-1) occurence for N nodes. The same rate applies
for star graphs with little imperfections. Additionally, the likelyhood for very large star structures to
develop with very large graphs (~E6 Nodes) is also very likely, with the graphs appearing as shallowly linked
individual structures rather than a cohesive unit.
