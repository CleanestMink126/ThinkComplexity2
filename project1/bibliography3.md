##### Summary:
This paper dives into abstracting a simulating systems such as the emerging network of IoT devices which desire
to send data to a desired location. Since it is not efficient for every node to know the state of the entire system,
a method of communication can be a form of "greedy algorithm" in which each nodes sends the data to the nearest neighbor
closest to the destination. However, they added in a probability that a node would become a "defector" which renders the
message unsendable and in large numbers invalidates the network. This probability is based on the number of defector neighbors
and how much a reward the node gets for properly delivering a message. They found that each graph they instantiate either
collapses into nearly all defector or participant given enough time. The probability of collapsing into each is heavily
influenced by both the size of the kickback the nodes recieve and the state of some "hubs" in the graph that connect to 
a large number of nodes. Additionally, they found the state of defectors tend to first organize themselves into clusters
of all participant or all defector.
